<h2>Optical limitations of light microscopy</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p class="blog">
	Optical microscopes (microscopes using visible light as a medium) are limited
	by their resolving power, setting a minimum length between two points that
	can be differentiated. For a long time this has limited us to specimens above
	the size range of 0.2 micrometres (about half of the wavelength of light).
	Although cells, bacteria and some cell organelles can be resolved, proteins
	and small molecules were outside the bounds of this technique. This has
	overall greatly limited our microscopic methods.
	It was Abbe in 1873 who first noted the above limitation on
	resolution and hence the underlying limit to light microscopy bears his name.

</p>

	<h3>Abbe’s limit</h3>
	<p class="blog">
		Below I will outline the geometric considerations leading us to Abbe’s limit
		on resolving power. The geometric method is chosen for its simplicity and
		ease of presentation. Imagine rays of light from a source travelling through
		the specimen into the lens. For a given microscope set-up we are asking, what
		the minimum distance between two points that can be seen through our
		objective is.

		In order for an image to be created by the light travelling through the lens,
		at least two beams of light have to coincide (at the point of focus). A single
		light beam is not enough to create a focused image. This is shown in the Figure 1 below.
		</p>

		<p class="blog">
		It simplifies our approach (without losing meaning) to think
		of the above set-up as a light beam traveling through a slit (the sample).
		Now the question becomes: how small is the smallest distance (\(d_{min}\)) between two
		slits such that we can still tell them apart.

		<br>


		We will find \(d_{min}\) on the sample when one of the light rays
		is hitting the edge of the lens. This will be the ray that for any two points
		maximises the angle at which the rays arrive and hence minimises \(d_{min}\).
		The below diagram details the case when a ray is hitting the edge of the lens.
		Here a ray of light is built from multiple waves (\(l_1, l_2\)) arriving from
		different slits.

		</div>

<p class="blog">
		This is the limiting case (as the ray is hitting the edge of the lense),
		and the two waves (\(l_1, l_2\)) combined
		will form a coherent light beam. Moreover this will be the first diffraction
		maxima (if there was another diffraction maxima before this that would mean
		we could make \(d_{min}\) even smaller until we find the first diffraction maxima just
		hitting the edge of the lense). This means the difference in distances
		travelled between the two waves will be \(\lambda\) as this is the first diffraction maxima.
		<br><br>
		We can see this in action in the Fig.3 and corresponding animation Fig.4.
		In the picture the slits are the wave sources. While the animation shows
		the now combined waves forming diffraction maxima.

		<p class="blog">
		We can now look at how this condition informs the resolving power. Let’s
		look back at Fig.2 geometrically. Fundamentally we want a geometrical connection
		between the minimum distance,\(d_{min}\), and the other known properties
		of the set-up, in order to put a lower bound on this distance.

		With this we can derive the travel distance  between two waves forming the
		first diffraction maxima: \(\Delta l = d \sin \theta \) (Due to the right
		angled triangle and \(\theta\)).
		Further, as these waves are coherent the difference in distance travelled
		will be \(\lambda\).

		Now we know \(\Delta l = d \sin \theta = \lambda\) giving a relation between
		\(\lambda\) wavelength and the angle \(\theta\).
		This is the sort of connection between known quantities and \(d_{min}\) we
		were looking for.
		<br>
		<br>
		There is one more thing to iron out before we arrive at
		Abbe’s formula.
		In this case we are referring to the \(\lambda\) that is present between
		the sample and the lens (this might not be the same wavelength as in normal
		conditions). The new wavelength can be written as depending on the refractive
		index of the material according to
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law">Snell-Descartes law</a>
		that is present between the sample and the lens (this might not be the same wavelength
		as in normal conditions). This will give us the final connection we were
		looking for.
		For a wave passing from one medium to the next the following
		holds for the refractive index:
		\(n_{2,1}=\frac{n_2}{n_2}=\frac{c_1}{c_2}=\frac{\lambda_1 f}{\lambda_2 f}=\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\)
		where \(n,c,f\) are the refractive index, the
		ray's speed and the frequency for the given medium.

		<br>
		<br>

		Let’s further simplify this for when the first medium is vacuum:
		\(\frac{n_2}{1}=\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{n_2}\).
		Now we can put this back into the first eqn to get the relation between
		the wavelength of the outside medium to the angle within
		\(\frac{\lambda_1}{n_2} =d \sin\theta \). <br>
		And we arrive at \(d = \frac{\lambda_1}{n_2 \sin\theta}\).

		<br>
		<br>
		Last we need to introduce a scaling factor of 0.61 due to properties of the lens:
		\(d = 0.61\frac{\lambda_1}{n_2 \sin \theta}\)
		here \(d\) is the resolving power (smallest distance that can be resolved)
		\(\lambda_2\) the wavelength in vacuum
		\(n_2\) refractive index of the material between the lens and the sample
		\(\theta\) aperture of the lense
		\(n\sin\theta\) is the numerical aperture.
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally we have Abbe's limiting factor \(d = 0.61\frac{\lambda_1}{n_2 \sin \theta}\).
		As we see above, this equation has described the fundamental limit to light
		microscopy that has been present ever since its invention. Abbe's limiting
		factor is the closest there is to having a physical limit to light microscopy.
		To put it simply it says the shorter the wavelength the better the resolution
		of the microscope. This is why in the next section X-rays and electron microscopes
		both with shorter wavelengths are introduced for resolving power.

		<h4>Resolving power as overlapping distributions</h4>

		<p class="blog">
		As we can simply approximate the waves leaving a point as a Gaussian
		distribution, if two points are close to each other the Guassians will have
		large parts of their distribution overlapping. Whereas if two points are
		sufficiently far from each other (outside the resolving power distance) the
		distribution will be easy to tell apart.
		So if we go above the resolving power of a microscope we will not be able
		to differentiate between two points. In Fig.5 the top two signals
		are well resolved, while the one at the bottom is not. The lowermost signal
		can be thought of as two Gaussians with very similar means.
		And in Fig.6 and Fig.7 we see two signals that are not resolved well
		and a signal that is well resolved represented as a dsitribution.

	<h3>The alternatives</h3>
<p class="blog">
		As the resolving power of light microscopy has been fundamentally limited,
		there have been various alternative ways of looking at small distances.
</p>

<h4>Immersion microscopy</h4>
<p class="blog">
		This technique uses light microscopes with oil between the sample
		and the objective. This gets around Abbe's limit by changing the refractive
		index \(n_2\)  in the eqn \(d = 0.61\frac{\lambda_1}{n_2 \sin \theta}\).
		If the refractive index is increased (and is above 1),
		we can see the minimum distance between two points that can be resolved will decrease.
		Oil has a refractive index of 1.515, hence a decreased minimum resolution
		distance and increased power. However this will only have 1.515 higher
		resolving power, leaving us still uncapable of looking at cell structure.

</p>

	<h4>X-ray crystallography</h4>
		<p class="blog">

		The electromagnetic waves are X-rays, meaning the small wavelength allows a
		higher resolving power. However, it relies on X-ray diffraction and Bragg’s
		law, so they can be only used on crystallised materials. Meaning living cells
		and organisms can’t be used. This is a major limitation.
		Nevertheless, X-ray crystallography was used in the experiments performed under
		the supervision of Rosalind Franklin to image DNA, providing crucial evidence
		for the helical structure of Watson and Crick’s model with the backbone being
		on the outside.
		</p>
	<h4>Electron microscopy</h4>
		<p class="blog">

		Here electrons are used for reflecting off our sample, again these have a
		higher frequency and shorter wavelength (shorter by \(10^{-5}\)) than the visible light
		spectrum. This results in 100x the resolving power compared to light microscopes
		Additionally, electron microscopes can be used on non-crystallised materials
		and have been crucial in determining the structure of cells. However,
		electron microscopes are not useful for imaging live cells, as specimens
		need to be prepared. This often means freezing, coating in metal or chemical
		fixation, all resulting in cell death.
