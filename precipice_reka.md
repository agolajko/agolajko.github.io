# Precipice notes

## March 24
- classification of Xrisk in precipice
- need to be  bayesian to think about the precipice
- classification of Xrisk in precipice ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2F6iJrPwsnNm?alt=media&token=a8a333b2-2f07-4bcc-b768-e456af230353)
- precipice is the name Ord gives to human period in which there is a high risk of humanity destroying itself
- need to be bayesian to think about precipice ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2F94yxZOKkjH?alt=media&token=d0d38b9d-7766-4170-afd4-a731bb16e8cb)
- precipice is different from the anthropocene as that is a geological epoch, while p is a part of humna history just as the enlightenment
- precipice if everyone decides to not have kids that would be an xrisk but not a painful one

## March 25
- precipice has a good structure, starts of with introducing xrisks, then details them in three categories (natural, anthropogenic, future) and finally outlines the path forward

## March 27
- precipice there have been some notable laboratory virus/bact escapes ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2Flp0sBDTJI9?alt=media&token=541138ca-c505-431e-b18a-5ca4d160b997)
- precipice there have been breakouts from BSL4 labs even: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2F2QJYNJIWNP?alt=media&token=35218b5b-4ac2-4bcf-a309-e785fe618703)
- precipice there are 55 BSL4 labs worldwide based on Wikipedia, however I am not expecting this to be anywhere accurate
- Reading the precipice again this morning, this chapter is on future risks, mainly talking about pandemics, AI and dystopian scenarios where humanity gets locked in to a state that overall curtails it's potential
- precipice dystopian scenarios, when we get locked in to a future we don't want. Three categories from the book, when noone want it but it happens, when it is desirable to some level and it happens, and when a small group wants it ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2FuHWogv38m2?alt=media&token=93437f43-a209-43a1-9474-6f535fed9d6e)
- precipice the bio weapons convention is underfunded and has no way of enforcement, as can be seen form the fact that many countries (Russia,Iraq, South Africa) have breached it
- precipice Pandemics, the main points: the plague killed approximately 30% of EU population Ziegler 1969 and the estimated population of EU was 88Million then.
The 1918 flue killed 3-6% of world population (1.8B)

## March 30
- precipice targeted vs broad interventions. Nick Beckstead highlights how in the past broad interventions would have been more effective. However this might have only been the case until concrete plans were missing (hence Einstein and Russell's focus on nuclear once it was more concrete). Also there is a lot of focus on board interventions, hence these are.probably less neglected
- precipice besides distinct xrisks there are also risk factors. If xrisks break risk into vertical silos, these cut across xrisks laterally, and increase probabilities. For example by his estimates a great-power war would increase the chance of extinction by 1% in the next century, making it more important than many other direct risks
- precipice these numbers combine to a 1 in 6 chance of an existential catastrophe in the next century. However these numbers assume humanity gets its act together. (if it didn't they would be higher)
- precipice existential security factors: reduce xrisk, eg better cooperation
- precipice Chapter:The  Risk Landscape; puts concrete numbers on risks ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2FWCzn6Cpeno?alt=media&token=6c88e241-a64b-4df5-a309-775363435ccc)
- precipice choose between risks using Cotton-Barratt's importance tractability neglectedness Framework
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2F9g-mL5iw4N?alt=media&token=76978411-c1ff-4ddc-b0cb-feb9bbc87da0)
- precipice he gives two more estimates: 1in 2 chance humanity fulfils it's potential on the long runs and avoids all existential catastrophes. And about a third of all xrisks of the future are in this century
- precipice interesting question, which risks are correlated and anti correlated? this determines how the probabilities add up ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2F979rLHpQpq?alt=media&token=26d0af72-496e-4958-95aa-57e0a6eca8a2)
- precipice all else equal, focus on soon, sudden and sharp risks. Soon: happens now instead of alter. Sudden: unfolds over the short time frame. Sharp: no warning signals (eg with pandemics smaller events are more likely and hence provide a warning shot)
- Environmental damage precipice: there might be some elements yet undiscovered that are essential for humans, however unlikely. Resource depletion probs will be fine
- Nuclear: during the development of the ABomb Teller proposed the idea that due to the high temperatures in the vicinity of the explosion, O2 and N in the air might ignite, causing the world to light on fire. This was heavily debated (with Fermi supporting Teller) however was dismissed in the end due to calculations by Bethe. However these calculations were still uncertain, and Bethe's report not entirely conclusive asking for more research. Even so the bomb was tested in July 1945 in Trinity.
On the other side of the war, the German scientists also realised a similar danger of atmospheric ignition, and escalated it to Hitler, who made dark joke about it.
Even so in 1954 US researchers asked what kind of fuel would allow thermonuclear explosion. They settled on enriched lithium-6, testing it under the codename Castle Bravo. Japan wasn't happy about the test. This produced much more energy than anticipated, 15 megatons instead of the 6 predicted. Hence in this case the effects were underestimated. precipice

- ok, reading the precipice again. Today's chapter was Anthropogenic Risks, consisting of Nuclear weapons, Climate change and Environmental Damage
- Climate change precipice: issues due to runaway greenhouse effects: increased water vapour in the air trapping more energy heating more the earth surface releaign more vapour. Methane released from Arctic permafrost and from deep see methane clathrate if melted.
Water vapour is unlikely temperature increase to the extent of boiling away all the water is unlikely to be triggered by human emissions alone. However there is a chance for not all of the water boiling off and still causing major issues. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2FR0q1gY-JN-?alt=media&token=f1dc32fb-ea25-4607-89fc-8befb8c70501) ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2F4sUjt9Ilxj?alt=media&token=f0e6e822-e188-4f63-822d-37a0a2fd4a89) ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2FadJq3bKa8-?alt=media&token=ef45b1bc-9830-4f03-81a5-e04e52c6ad47)

## March 31
- precipice Humanity has a three step project ahead: 1) Reach existential security 2) the long reflection wheere it can figure out plans and actions at which it has a single shot of success 3) achieving our potential
- precipice some of these risks are without precedent hence we need to make sure our institutions can handle this. Our institutions need to learn to 1) handle risks that threaten everything 2) need to learn to not fail even once 3) we need to predict before unseen and hard to know risks, hence need to pump up on knowledge
- precipice safeguarding humanity is a global public good and is undersupplied. any country will only capture a fraction of the benefits it creates. Hence need for international coordination. Unclear how big changes such as world government would work, however small changes are possible. Eg more funding for the Biological Weapons Convention. Or restarting the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). Further how could law be used to regulate existential risks using law, would fit with idea of human rights and crimes against humanity.
- precipice The Montreal Protocol was one of the most successful international agreements. They set a timetable for phasing out chemicals depleting the ozone layer
- precipice Differential technological development, develop tech that is crucial for long term success first
- precipice state risks and transition risks: the longer we are stuck in a state the higher the chance of failure (being destroyed by asteroids). We want to move through these as quick as possible. Whereas the more and less thought through transitions we make the higher the risk of transition risks. Want to make sure the transition is good




## April 1
- precipice and here we are, the final chapter of the precipice. Talking about Our Potential. Starts with an excellent quote: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FAgo%2Fhp8bnyYVu1?alt=media&token=7c175062-bc01-47c4-adba-dddea82857d4)
- precipice in 10 million years even the damage to biodiversity will be restored, and in only 100k years the natural systems will rid us of 90% of co2 released by humans
- precipice solar system < galaxy (milky way) <  group (local group)< cosmic web
- precipice observable universe is 46B light years, the eventually observable 63B, however the affectable universe is only 16B
